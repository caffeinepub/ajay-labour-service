  "summary": "The diff implements the super admin configuration feature with backend storage, authentication checks, frontend AdminGuard updates, and comprehensive logging throughout. All four requirements (REQ-47, REQ-48, REQ-49, REQ-50) appear to be implemented with evidence in the modified files.",

      "description": "Migration module (backend/migration.mo) added to handle state migration with new superAdmin field",
      "reason": "Migration infrastructure was not requested in BuildRequest. The requirement only specified storing super admin principal in stable storage, not creating a separate migration module.",

      "description": "Extensive Layout.tsx modifications with authentication state logging and QueryClient cache clearing",
