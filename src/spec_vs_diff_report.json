  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all three requirements: REQ-1 (rename website to 'Assam Labour Service'), REQ-2 (add Daily Labour Service to Services page), and REQ-3 (add Daily Labour Service to homepage). All changes are frontend-only as constrained. However, there appear to be two nearly identical service entries on the Services page ('Daily Wage Labour' and 'Daily Labour Service'), which may be redundant but technically fulfills the requirement.",

    {
      "description": "Two similar daily labour service entries exist on ServicesPage: 'Daily Wage Labour' (pre-existing) and 'Daily Labour Service' (newly added). The diff shows both services with nearly identical descriptions and features.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 requested adding 'Daily Labour Service' as a new service, but the implementation added it alongside the existing 'Daily Wage Labour' service rather than replacing or consolidating them. This creates potential user confusion with two very similar service offerings.",
